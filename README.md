Hello~ I am from Korea and my English name is Alex. 
I am currently English teacher in Korea and recently got interested in coding, especially in python, pygame and kivy language.
I hope this site helps me with taking care of some problems I will face in the near future.
I guess I need to add something more to know how this site works.

I uploaded a file n_times_n, which is for my elementary 3rd grade son to practice n times n. If you have any idea, going over the code I wrote feel free to give a suggestion.
